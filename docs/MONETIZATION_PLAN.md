# Monetization Plan

This document outlines a potential revenue model for the Basketball Highlight Reel application. It is a proposal only and not yet implemented in code.

## 1. Subscription & Payment Options
### 1.1 Monthly Subscription
- **Basic Plan** – 1080p output, limited highlight reels, basic AI assistance.
- **Pro Plan** – 4K output, unlimited reels, advanced AI, priority rendering, premium effects.
- **Elite Plan** – all Pro features plus exclusive templates, styles, and early access to new tools.

Subscribed users get no ads, faster rendering, high‑quality downloads, and access to exclusive libraries.

### 1.2 One‑Time Payments
- **Basic Fee** – generate one standard highlight reel (1080p) with standard effects.
- **Premium Fee** – generate one premium reel (4K, custom transitions, advanced AI).

Useful for users who do not want a recurring subscription.

## 2. Free‑to‑Use Model with Ads
- **Ad‑supported free version** – users watch ads during video processing.
- **Rewarded ads** – users can watch longer ads for perks such as faster processing, temporary access to premium features, or credits toward premium reels.
- **Ad‑free upgrades** – pay once or subscribe to remove ads entirely.

## 3. Payment Integration and Flow
- Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Apple/Google Pay).
- Allow subscription management (cancel, upgrade/downgrade) from account settings.
- Offer a 7‑ or 14‑day free trial for premium tiers.
- Provide clear pricing pages and payment history.

## 4. Rewards & Incentives
- Credit system for watching ads that can be redeemed for faster rendering or premium effects.
- Referral program to earn credits or discounts.

## 5. Premium Features
- Priority processing and dedicated support for paying users.
- High‑quality video rendering up to 4K.
