# basketball-highlight-reel
AI-powered basketball highlight reel generator.

This project contains a simple Express server and a collection of helper
functions for planning video highlight reels. The main logic lives in
`renderPlan.js` and `highlightAlgorithm.js`.

`highlightAlgorithm.js` documents the high-level steps used to create a
highlight reel, including video upload handling, segmentation, highlight
detection, audio synchronization, transitions, rendering and storage.
Actual implementations of these functions would integrate video processing
libraries and AI models.
